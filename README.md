# Rainmeter Skins

Rainmeter is a powerful desktop customization tool for Windows that allows users to create and display customizable skins on their desktops. Below is a compilation of all the skins I've made so far.

## Lite7

Lite7 is a windows 7 inspired translucent theming for basic widgets. Included in the skin is a clock+date widget, a notes widget (still in beta) and a system and network management widget.

### Note: This repo will be on pause (wow only one skin, how busy must i be) as I have switched from Windows to Linux (pop btw) and am gonna try and configure a windows vm before i blindly write lua code :D
